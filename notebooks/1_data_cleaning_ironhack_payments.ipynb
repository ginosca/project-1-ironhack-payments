`reimbursement_date`\n","\n","The majority of missing values are tied to expected business scenarios:\n","\n","- `money_back` (14,748) → Already reimbursed; no future reimbursement date needed\n","- `rejected` (5,261) → Denied during manual review; never reached the reimbursement stage\n","- `direct_debit_rejected` (748) → Reimbursement failed due to bank rejection; repayment must be handled through recovery\n","- `canceled` (28) → Request was never confirmed by the user; canceled before approval\n","- `transaction_declined` (44) → Transfer failed; reimbursement never scheduled\n","- `direct_debit_sent` (33) → Waiting for confirmation of the debit result; reimbursement date may be set later\n","- `active` (58) → Funds received by user, but reimbursement not yet scheduled\n","\n","### 🧠 Conclusion:\n","\n","- Most missing values are **logically expected** based on the request status.\n","- No rows require imputation or removal.\n","- We will leave `reimbursement_date` as `NaT` for these records, since this column is **not used for cohort creation or metric calculations**.\n","\n","---\n"],"metadata":{"id":"WLzwgy_pSMY3"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["---\n","\n","### 🔍 Step 8C.1: Validating `cash_request_id` Before Merge\n","\n","To ensure the
